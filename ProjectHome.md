## Real time TDDFT for Quantum-Espresso ##

This code implements the real-time propagation of wavefunctions for
[Quantum-Espresso](http://www.quantum-espresso.org). The initial code
was written by X. Qian and D. Ceresoli at MIT, in the 2008-2009 period.

Very shortly a user manual and a tutorial will appear on this site.

Planned features:
  * Ehrenfest dynamics
  * arbitrary pulses
  * extension to periodic solids
